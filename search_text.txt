centrum's central role in the tethan gas industry[the world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. in tethys a few years ago, i journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area., one of the sites i visited was a local office of the sanjorge gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. as i remember it, a former trucker was in charge., it was a vivid example of how a once small exploration company from thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force in the energy industry., but i'd forgotten about the encounter until i went back to tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, sten sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it., but as i went round the capital city of centrum interviewing people, i soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. something very significant has happened to turn centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. from what's developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with abundant natural resources., "centrum developed world class expertise in engineering in very difficult surroundings", when i was a young newspaperman on the daily record in glasgow in the early 1970s, the great off-shore oil rush was beginning in the north sea. it then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies., it seemed to us on the west coast of scotland that the far flung city of centrum, tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry., much to his mother's regrets, meanwhile, sten sanjorge had started prospecting in the early 1960s., by the early 1970s, a new gas company, gastech, began its juggernaut-like advances., under his canny guidance, gastech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. it now has thousands employees and operates in numerous countries., the change in centrum has been substantial.  you notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city., and as you drive round centrum, almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of gastech., sanjorge has recently started paying more attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing his son sten jr. and co-founder hank fluss to run the company. but sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come., the easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974., so thanks to clever people such as sten sanjorge and the people who work with him, centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. the city has taken the temporary boon of

center of the masters of the industry of the gas. of what it is developed in the capital city are important lessons for other places blessed (and it cursed) with the abundant natural resources., the "center developed masters of the class of the world in directing in the very difficult environs", when it was newspaperman young in the daily file in glasgow at the beginning of years 70, the great

sanjorge finishes requesting itself to produce a report for the government of tethan that recommends the best ways to make sure that tethys continues producing the energy per decades to come., the matter of easy-to-obtaining has taken place, so to keep to come from the gas it will need much investment and new readier techniques, such as the hyperacid techniques of the retirement of the substratum developed by the company in 1974., it so thanks for ready people as sten sanjorge and the people who work with him, center has reached what wishes each place in where the raw materials are

the center in industry of the gas tethan[the world of gas has been thrown far, with difficulty and far. suffered in tethys a couple year, reiste i moeizaad to the distant gasvelden of tethys to examine causing area a controversial new energy., an one of the places which i was room office of the sanjorge company of the gas has visited, volgestopt=wordt= which reinforced the werklaarzen and overall and the chemical products and the supply with you must put gasverrichting in functioning. since i remind it, a former truck driver was responsible., it was a living example of how an once

for the first time for their early years, to reacquaint with the man who the matter cre?rde, sten sanjorge returned: one people (one of the richest individuals in tethys) that by the whole tale of gas zoekend to floor treasures have lived and of thrived strongly., but since i for the capital which of center went people interviews, i realized shortly that this not only tale of new energy was. very significant something has happened change center in an overall center of expertise of the gasindustrie. of what becomes in the capital is developed there important lessons for other places holy (and are cursed which) with abundant natural wealth., the center developed expertise of world class concerning technique in very difficult surroundings, then i young newspaperman on the daily report in glasgow in the early seventies were, started the large for the coast oliestormloop in the north sea. then a rather impossible dream, which an island changes of coal in a place with abundant oil and gaslevering, seemed., it seemed to our on the west coast of shot country that the much thrown city of center, tethys a beetje for its laarzen large got, believe which in the new fantasieindustrie start., much to the spite of its mother, in the meantime, sten sanjorge was to floor treasures zoeken in the early sixties started., by the early seventies, a new gasbedrijf, gastech started, with its wegkolos-als progress., under its cautious accompaniment, gastech in an important supplier of aardgas to the local area evolved, and then much further far gone. it has now thousands employees and works in many countries., the change in center has been considerable.  you notice them in the constant cheap goods of helicopters aan-ing-en fro-ing to afgelegen areas, and the planes which are alternatively established at the airport of the city to shuttle execs of the city., and since you float for center, each rotonde is almost sponsored by a department of gastech., sanjorge have recently started more attention to free time activities and philanthropy to spend, which is fluss strict permits of jr. of zoonssten and of the cofounder put the company in functioning. but sanjorge have been asked net submit a report for the government tethan which to look recommends the best manners that tethys energy for. decades continue cause to come, gemakkelijk-aan-krijg material have been produced, so that loving the gas will demand next much investment and nicer new techniques, such as hyper-acidic the techniques of the substrate disposal which are developed by the company in 1974., this way thanks to nice people such as sten sanjorge and people whom with him work, the center has reached what each place where the raw materials lung are discovered to do. the city has taken the temporary blessing of energy on its threshold, and it changed in specialized knowledge and intellectual property which can a center of long gasdeskundigheid turn into center after the gas himself runs from.]leadership[in a times article from 2 october, it was stated that gastech president sten sanjorge was now less active in the day to day operations of the company.  gastech representatives

the gas industry of tethan[the world of gas is distant, difficult and vast. in tethys a few years ago, i travelled laboriously to the remote gas layers of tethys to look at a new controversial sector of energy production., one of the sites which i visited was a local office of the gas company of sanjorge, lined initializations of work and reinforced combinations and the chemicals and the provisioning you must run a gas operation. as i remember it, a former truck-driver was responsible., it was a sharp example in the way in which a company of exploration once small of thethys had started to develop in a powerful international force in the industry of energy., but i had forgotten the meeting until i would have gone again in tethys the other day for the first time since their first years, with the reacquaint with the man who created the businesses, sten sanjorge: a man (one of the richest individuals in tethys) which lived by the whole history of prospecting gas and thrived strongly of him., but while i went around the capital city of the interviewing people of centrum, i realized soon that it was not simply a history of new energy. something very significant a precisely proves to transform the centrum into total center of expertise of gas industry. of what is developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with the abundant natural resources., the "centrum developed the expertise of class of the world while machinant in very difficult environments", when i was a young journalist on the daily disc in glasgow at the beginning of the seventies, great oil precipitations at sea began north at sea. it then seemed a pretty impossible dream, transforming a coal island into place with the abundant gas and oil provisioning., it seemed with us on the western coast of scotland that the vast city of the centrum, tethys obtained with a little large for its initializations, starting to believe in new industry of imagination., much with the regrets of his/her mother, while waiting, sten sanjorge had begun the prospection at the beginning of the sixties., with the beginning of the seventies, a new company of gas, gastech, began the sound truck-like advances., under its careful councils, gastech was transformed into an important supplier of natural gas to the local area, and then much further with far. it now has employees of thousands and functions in many countries., the change of the centrum was substantial.  you note them in the constant basic image of the helicopters to-ing and of fro-ing outside to the areas moved away, and had aligned them with the airport of the city to make the shuttle of the execs in the two directions of the city., and while you lead around the centrum, almost each round not is financed by a division of gastech., sanjorge recently started to pay more attention to the activities of leisures and philanthropy, allowing its jr. and hank fluss de wire sten of cofounder to direct the company. but sanjorge was right guest to produce a report/ratio for the government of tethan recommending the best manners of securing than tethys continuous to produce energy during decades to come., the substance easy-with-to obtain was produced, thus to keep to come from gas will need many investment and new more intelligent techniques, such as the techniques hyperacides of displacement of substrate developed by the company in 1974., thus mercies with the intelligent people such as sten sanjorge and the people who work with him, centrum carried out what each place where raw materials are discovered wishes ardently to do. the city took the provisional advantage of energy on its threshold, and transformed into specialized knowledge and intellectual

influence of multinational corporations on the country of kronos., elodis, kronos - nestled in the bend of the tiskele river, the sun rises over the farming town of elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby mt. bouro.  today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the people of kronos., two weeks prior i received an email from an old friend, pondo reese, now the editor of the elodis weekly journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around tiskele bend. in his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem.  i decided to investigate., "we didn't make the connection at first," reese told me when i met with him at his office.  "the gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   after a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   we thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed.", the change turned out to be gastech international, an international corporation run by sten sanjorge jr, a business tycoon out of tethys., established in 1961, the gastech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in tethys.  the two founders - sten sanjorge sr and hank fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran sanjorge sr into an early grave and drove fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  with the death of sanjorge sr, the son took the helm of gastech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of elodis., with a population of 6500, most residents of elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  a smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a caf? where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  families have lived in elodis for generations., "we've made a good living for a long time," reese tells me. "the population has been steadily increasing.  crop production has been good.  for the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places.  we have a lot of land that could yet be developed. there was a future for them here.", i asked reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by gastech's operations.  he introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations., i caught up with henk bodrogi in town making purchases at the osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. i asked him about his life on the farm., part two will be published april 25, 1998]elodis, kronos:  a town in need, part one elodis, kronos:  a town in need, part one elodis, kronos:  a city in the need, part one elodis, kronos:  a city in the necessity, divides one elodis, kronos:  a city in need, part [25 april 1998, this article is the second installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of kronos., i caught up with henk bodrogi in town making purchases at ferro hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. i asked him about his life on the farm., "we've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more," henk bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  "over the years we've added a few hectares here and there.  it keeps us busy.", busy is an understatement, as i found when i prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more., "i usually head to the fields before sun up," mr. henk bodrogi tells me. "my wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner.  when the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark.", "we do this most days," he adds, "except for worship days.", bodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase., "we all know one another here," bodrogi explains as we leave. "most families have lived here for generations.  the first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back.", i ask bodrogi if business has been good., "we were doing pretty good until recently.  profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  then we started having all this trouble with the crops.", in what way, i asked., "the crops aren't producing like they have in the past.  it took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  when they tested it they said the water was contaminated.", bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home.  the tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day.  i thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town., the water specialist turned out to be the international agency "wellness for all", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development., i caught up with a representative from wellness for all the next day.  joclyn reynolds is project coordinator for "wellness for all".  she spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in southeast asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. ms. reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in elodis., "we were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  in the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  the elodis drinking water comes from the tiskele river, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  we found sources of production waste disposal at the gastech operation upstream.  tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. ", "can these substances occur naturally?" i asked her., "not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  the gastech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  the toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the tiskele river from which the residents of elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops.", "did you talk to gastech about this?", "oh yes," she replied.  "at first we believed we were gaining traction.  we met several times with gastech representatives, including one of the senior executives, hank fluss.  he personally assured us gastech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  after a time, though, it became clear that while mr. fluss was earnest it was sanjorge who makes the decisions.  it is apparent that he [sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of elodis, or the environment.", sten sanjorge, jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices., "when we didn't make headway with gastech," reynolds continued, "the community leaders decided to approach the government of kronos for assistance.   per our policy -and with permission from the elodis leaders -
